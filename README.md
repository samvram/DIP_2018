# DIP_2018
This repository is solely for completion of the subject **AV489 - Image and Video Processing**. The rigorous programming assignments
are for the semester of **July-December, 2018** at **Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology**.

The assignment has been divided into 10 questions of which the first five are done in Python language in Jupyter Notebook framework.
The second part of the assignment has been solved in MATLAB, and provides an overall glimpse of the whole semester.
The assignment has been provided by teaching assistant **Ms. Soumya Sara John**, and course instructor **Dr. Deepak Mishra**.
